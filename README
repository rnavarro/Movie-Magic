Movie Magic v1.2.1 Beta
***************************************

Description
===========
This little script makes some super crazy movie magic!

The script looks for a .nfo file or an imdb.txt file containing the movie imdb url,
from this it queries imdb for the title and release year of the movie

If the movie is an "asian" film (based on the country criteria in config.php) it
moves those movies into a different directory and translates the titles to their
US english equivalents.
