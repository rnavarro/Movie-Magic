Movie Magic v1.2 Beta
***************************************

Description
===========
This little script makes some super crazy movie magic!
It queries imdb for the title and release year of the movie
If the movie is an "asian" film (based on my country criteria below) it moves those movies into a different directory and translates the titles to their US english equivalents.
 
Requirements
============
